                        <p>
                            For decades, we`ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. “Fuck
                            positivity,” Mark Manson says. “Let`s be honest,
                            shit is fucked and we have to live with it.” In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson
                            doesn`t sugar-coat or equivocate. He tells it like
                            it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art
                            of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling,
                            let`s-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected American society and spoiled a generation,
                            rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. <br>
                            Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that
                            improving our lives hinges not on our ability to
                            turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed
                            and limited—“not everybody can be extraordinary,
                            there are winners and losers in society and some of it is not fair or your fault.” Manson
                            advises us to get to know our limitations and accept
                            them. Once we embrace our fears, faults and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding
                            and start confronting painful truths, we can begin
                            to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity and forgiveness we
                            seek. <br>

                    Established in 2023, Sherlock bookstore's aim is to create a community of book lovers throughout the
                    nation, especially those who favor crime/detective
                    novels. There, not only can customers browse for books, but they can also become a member of the
                    community, where they can build the reading habit and share
                    feelings through each page of book.
