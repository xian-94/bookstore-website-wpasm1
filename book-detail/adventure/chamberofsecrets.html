                        <p>
                            The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get
                            back to the Hogwarts School for
                            Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a
                            strange, impish creature named
                            Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. <br>
                            And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors
                            arise, including an outrageously
                            stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the
                            girls' bathroom, and the unwanted
                            attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. <br>
                            But each of these seems minor annoyance when the real trouble begins, and someone--or
                            something--starts turning Hogwarts
                            students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it
                            possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious
                            past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry
                            Potter himself?

                <p>
                    J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series,
                    which have sold over 600
                    million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made
                    into eight smash hit movies.
                    To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including `Fantastic
                    Beasts and Where to Find Them`,
                    which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry`s story
                    as a grown-up was continued
                    in a stage play, `Harry Potter and the Cursed Child`, which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack
                    Thorne and director John Tiffany. <br>
                    In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale `The Ickabog`, the
                    royalties for which she donated to
                    her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid
                    19 pandemic. Her latest children`s
                    novel, `The Christmas Pig`, was published in 2021. <br>
                    J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective
                    series written under the name Robert Galbraith.
                    She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the
                    international children`s care reform charity Lumos.
                    J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.
