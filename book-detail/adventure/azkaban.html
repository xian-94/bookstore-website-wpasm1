                        <p>
                            For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius
                            Black. Convicted of killing
                            thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord,
                            Voldemort. <br>
                            Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's
                            defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's
                            downfall as well. And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at
                            Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." <br>
                            Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his
                            friends. Because on top of it
                            all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.

                    J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series,
                    which have sold over 600
                    million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made
                    into eight smash hit movies.
                    To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including `Fantastic
                    Beasts and Where to Find Them`,
                    which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry`s story
                    as a grown-up was continued
                    in a stage play, `Harry Potter and the Cursed Child`, which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack
                    Thorne and director John Tiffany. <br>
                    In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale `The Ickabog`, the
                    royalties for which she donated to
                    her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid
                    19 pandemic. Her latest children`s
                    novel, `The Christmas Pig`, was published in 2021. <br>
                    J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective
                    series written under the name Robert Galbraith.
                    She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the
                    international children`s care reform charity Lumos.
                    J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.
