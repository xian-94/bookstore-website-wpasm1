                    Established in 2023, Sherlock bookstore's aim is to create a community of book lovers throughout the
                    nation, especially those who favor crime/detective
                    novels. There, not only can customers browse for books, but they can also become a member of the
                    community, where they can build the reading habit and share
                    feelings through each page of book.
